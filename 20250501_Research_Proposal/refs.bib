  abstract  = {MASCOT (`Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout') is a 10 kg mobile surface science package part of JAXA's Hayabusa2 sample return mission. The mission was launched in December 2014 from Tanegashima Space Center, Japan. The Hayabusa2 spacecraft reached the target asteroid in summer 2018. After a mapping phase of the asteroid and a landing site selection process the MASCOT lander was deployed to the surface on the 3rd of October 2018. MASCOT operated successfully for about 17 h on the surface of Ryugu. It performed three relocation manoeuvres and one ``Mini-Move'' and returned 128 MBytes of data. MASCOT has been developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in cooperation with the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). The main objectives were to perform in-situ investigations of the asteroid surface and to support the sampling site selection for the mother spacecraft. These objectives could be reached successfully. On 6th December 2020 Hayabusa2 successfully returned asteroid samples to the Earth.},
